# Leadership in Software Engineering

## The Listener: Leadership Begins with Hearing Others

In my journey as a software developer, I’ve come to appreciate the truth in Jamie Smyth’s insight: “People, Process, then Tools. In that order. Always.” You cannot put people first—on your team or in your organization—if you aren’t willing to truly listen to them. Listening means engaging with others’ experiences, understanding their perspectives, and being present enough to earn their trust. I’ve adopted a few principles to help me assess whether I’m genuinely listening to my team and users—or simply going through the motions.

**Key Thought:** Listening is not just a soft skill—it’s foundational. If you don’t truly hear people, you can’t support or lead them effectively.

- **Patience Builds Trust:** Everyone communicates differently. A good leader listens first, without rushing to fix or judge.
- **Value Others’ Voices:** Real listening starts with respect. If you don’t value someone’s thoughts, you won’t truly hear them.
- **Welcome Correction:** No one is immune to blind spots. Growth comes when we receive correction with openness and humility.
- **Engage with Intent:** Make people feel heard. Eye contact, affirmation, and thoughtful follow-up show that their input matters. People speak more freely when they know they’re being heard—and that’s how teams thrive.

## The Learner: Growth Fuels Impact

I love to learn. Any subject, any time, any place. As a child, I was often found reading—and on more than one occasion, grounded from books as punishment. These days, I find the same joy in exploring new programming languages, solving toy problems, or revisiting old subjects like algebra. What draws me to software development is the constant need to grow.

**Key Thought:** If you stop growing, your ability to lead fades quickly.

- **Be a Self-Starter:** Continuously look for ways to improve the team, yourself, and the systems you’re crafting—and take the initiative to test ideas and address issues before being asked.
- **Adapt to Stay Effective:** When your current skills fall short, it’s time to try new things.
- **Apply Quickly:** Knowledge is most powerful when put into practice. Learning should lead to doing.
- **Learn from Others’ Work:** Read deeply and widely. Honor the effort and insight others have shared, and allow their contributions to inform and expand your perspective.
- **Refine Your Craft:** Mastery comes through iteration. Keep shaping, testing, and improving your skills. There’s always more to learn.

## The Leader: Growth Multiplied Through Others

I’ve often found myself in leadership roles—on the Ultimate Frisbee field, the high school basketball team, and in software development. Rather than shy away from those responsibilities, I’ve embraced them and continually refine my thinking on what leadership means.

**Key Thought:** Leadership isn’t a solo act—it’s a responsibility to others. It’s about action, ownership, and enabling people to do their best work.

- **Act with Initiative:** Take action to remove friction, clear obstacles, and model the behaviors that enable others to succeed. Leadership means stepping forward without dragging others along—making space for momentum, not mandates.
- **Fail Fast and Learn:** The more you try, the more you’ll fail—and the more you’ll succeed.
- **Leave Things Better:** Make an impact, whether small or large. Leadership is about improving lives—through thoughtful processes, safe teams, and resilient products. Every decision, conversation, and correction has the potential to ease someone’s burden, spark joy, or open up opportunity.
- **Own the Outcome:** Successes and failures alike—take responsibility and grow from both.
- **Mentor with Intention:** Leadership means growing others. Don’t solve everything for them—guide them toward solving it themselves.
- **Embrace Ownership:** You’re not just writing code—you’re building a product. Take full responsibility for its success.

Each of these areas—listening, learning, and leading—reinforce one another. When practiced together, they form the foundation of impactful, human-centered software engineering leadership.
